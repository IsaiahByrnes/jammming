#Jammming (Codecademy Project)

The Jammming web application allows you to search for music, add it to a playlist and then save that playlist to your spotify account. This app was made using some prebuilt components and guidance from the Codecademy Front-End Engineer ciriculum. The app is simple and is more of a display of working with API's and React State.

You can use this app by simply cloning it and running it like a basic react app.
